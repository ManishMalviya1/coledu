REQUIREMENTS: MySQL, Code editor(any), Xampp(or any alternate...)
1. Create a database and import coledu.sql in it.
2. Copy WHOLE content of folder: “FRONT-END (php, css, js, images & icons)” including “images” folder and all 
type of php, css and js file as it is. (simply: Just go inside folder and press ctrl+a -> ctrl+c).
